## Store a payment method through payment object

A payment object is an object generated by the PAYMILL API. The nonsensitive parts of the payment data of your clients are stored here. You can use them to create transactions or for documentation purposes.

<p class="important">
<span class="heading">**Requirements:**</span>
You have an account. (You can register [here](https://app.paymill.com)).
<br>
Use of the API: You have [authenticated](/API) yourself.
</p>


## 1. Create client

In order to store the credit card data of a client, you must create his profile first.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li class="active"><a href="#create-client-mc" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Merchant Centre</a></li>
  <li><a href="#create-client-curl" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">CURL</a></li>
</ul>


<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane active" id="create-client-mc">
    On the homepage, go to **Clients** and click **New client**

    ![Create Client](/guides/images/payment_method-01.jpg)
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="create-client-curl">
    <pre>
      ```
      curl https://api.paymill.com/v2.1/clients \
        -u <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>: \
        -d "email=lovely-client@example.com" \
        -d "description=Lovely Client"
      ```
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>


## 2. Create payment method

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li class="active"><a href="#create-payment-method-mc" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Merchant Centre</a></li>
  <li><a href="#create-payment-method-curl" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">CURL</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane active" id="create-payment-method-mc">
  Store the credit card data.

  Go to the details page of your client and click on **Create payment method** in the **Means of payment** section.


  ![Create Payment Method](/guides/images/payment_method-02.jpg)

  Select your desired payment type and enter the applicable information. Only specific credit card information / bank details are allowed in test mode. You can find the list here. Usage of any other data will result in error.

  ![Payment Method Form](/guides/images/payment_method-03.jpg)

  You can store several payment methods for a client.

  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="create-payment-method-curl">
    For the creation of a payment object via API you must enter a [token](https://support.paymill.com/hc/en-us/articles/201805608-What-exactly-is-a-token-). You can get this token through the [PAYMILL Bridge](/guides/reference/paymill-bridge.html). You can also find additional information on our [support page](https://support.paymill.com/hc/en-us/articles/200261507-How-can-I-store-credit-card-data-without-charging-a-transaction-immediately-).




    <span class="heading">Create new credit card payment with token and client</span>

        -u <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>: \
        -d "token=<PAYMILL_TOKEN>" \

<p class="important">
**Important:**
In the created payment object, the nonsensitive parts of the payment data of your clients are now stored. For all subsequent transactions and subscriptions, only the payment object is needed.
</p>


## 3. Validity of the payment method


**LIVE mode**
<br>
If no transaction is yet to be created with the payment object, the payment method is not yet valid. With the help of a preauthorization, you can validate your payment method without having to carry out a transaction. The preauthorization should occur within half a day of creating the payment object (if no transaction has occurred yet with this payment method).

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li class="active"><a href="#pm-validity-mc" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Merchant Centre</a></li>
  <li><a href="#pm-validity-curl" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">CURL</a></li>
</ul>


<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane active" id="pm-validity-mc">
    A preauthorization of your payment object is only possible over the API.
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="pm-validity-curl">
    During preauthorization over the API, it is required to input the live key, the payment object ID, the amount (this **must** correspond to the value during token creation), and the currency.


    <pre>
      ```
      curl https://api.paymill.com/v2.1/preauthorizations \
        -u <DEIN_PRIVATE_KEY>: \
        -d "payment=pay_d43cf0ee969d9847512b" \
        -d "amount=4200" \
        -d "currency=EUR"
      ```
    </pre>

## 4. Create a payment

Create a new transaction with one of the payment types that are assigned to your client.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li class="active"><a href="#create-payment-mc" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Merchant Centre</a></li>
  <li><a href="#create-payment-curl" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">CURL</a></li>
</ul>


<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane active" id="create-payment-mc">
    On the detail page of your **client**, you can now create a new transaction by clicking on **Create transaction** in the **Transactions** section. If you have created several payment methods, they are made available for you to select from under **Payment type**.

    ![Create Transaction](/guides/images/payment_method-05.jpg)
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="create-payment-curl">
    With your created payment methods, you can make a payment through the API in the following way:
    <br><br>

    **Transaction with payment**

    <pre>
