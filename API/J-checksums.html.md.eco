Checksum validation is a simple method to ensure the integrity of transferred data. Basically, we generate a hash out of the given parameters and your private API key. If you send us a request with transaction data and the generated checksum, we can easily validate the data. To make the checksum computation as easy as possible we provide this endpoint for you.

For transactions that are started client-side, e.g. PayPal checkout, it is *required* to first create a checksum on your server and then provide that checksum when starting the transaction in the browser. The checksum needs to contain *all* data required to subsequently create the actual transaction.
